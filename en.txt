Included Data
Collecting this data helps us improve Minecraft by guiding us in directions that are relevant to our players.\nYou can also send in additional feedback to help us keep improving Minecraft.
Telemetry Data Collection
Understanding the context behind receiving an advancement can help us better understand and improve the progression of the game.
Advancement Made
This event can help us figure out where startup performance improvements are needed by measuring the execution times of the startup phases.
Game Load Times
%s (Optional)
Knowing the overall performance profile of Minecraft helps us tune and optimize the game for a wide range of machine specifications and operating systems. \nGame version is included to help us compare the performance profile for new versions of Minecraft.
Performance Metrics
%s (Required)
It\u2019s important for us to understand how long it takes to join a world, and how that changes over time. For example, when we add new features or do larger technical changes, we need to see what impact that had on load times.
World Load Times
Knowing how players play Minecraft (such as Game Mode, client or server modded, and game version) allows us to focus game updates to improve the areas that players care about most.\nThe World Loaded event is paired with the World Unloaded event to calculate how long the play session has lasted.
World Loaded
This event is paired with the World Loaded event to calculate how long the world session has lasted.\nThe duration (in seconds and ticks) is measured when a world session has ended (quitting to title, disconnecting from a server).
